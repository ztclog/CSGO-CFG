# how to use
Just place all the .cfg files in directory:

	X:\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\Counter-Strike Global Offensive\csgo\cfg\
	
place 99-Customfonts.conf in directory:

	X:\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\Counter-Strike Global Offensive\csgo\panorama\fonts\conf.d\
	
If you are not a Windows steam user, please place in the other right directory.

99-Customfonts.conf is to change in-game font pattern. Note: the file's name must begin with "99-"

It should be okay to load cfgs by inputing:

	exec foobar.cfg
	
in game console.
